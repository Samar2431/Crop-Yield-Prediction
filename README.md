🌾 Crop Yield Prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project predicts crop yield based on historical agricultural data. Using machine learning techniques, it helps farmers, researchers, and policymakers estimate productivity and make better decisions in agriculture.

The repository contains:

A Jupyter Notebook (crop yield prediction.ipynb) for model building & evaluation.

An application script (app.py) for running predictions.

A dataset (crop yield data sheet.xlsx) used for training/testing.

Documentation (crop yield prediction.pdf and description.md).

⚙ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook

Required libraries (install with pip):


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

▶ Usage

Option 1: Run Jupyter Notebook

1. Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook "crop yield prediction.ipynb"

2. Run all cells to train the model and view results.

Option 2: Run Application Script

1. Execute the app:

python app.py

2. The script will load the trained model and predict crop yield based on input data.
📊 Dataset

The dataset (crop yield data sheet.xlsx) contains agricultural parameters such as:

Crop type

Environmental conditions

Yield values

📈 Model

Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression / Random Forest / etc.) are applied.

The notebook includes data preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.

📝 Future Improvements

Expand dataset with more crops and regions.

Deploy app with a web interface (Flask/Streamlit).

Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
